        The world looks more and more like a banana republic every day. Peel
        back the skin and you find questionable intentions, a lack of alignment
        among global decision makers, a fundamental disconnect in purpose –
        makes you think anyone else could slice it better.
        <br />
        <br />
        Well, go ahead and try. <br />
        <br />
        We’ve minted 88 pieces of esteemed photographer Peggy Anderson’s
        collection Banana République as 1/1 NFTs. These photographs were
        captured by chance across Paris over a span of five years. Discarded
        banana peels represent the turmoil of a rejected generation thrown on
        the ground and left to rot on the streets, but the photographs also find
        beauty in the absurd and banal. 88% of the NFT sale proceeds will slip
        directly into the banana stand because there’s always money in it which
        will be controlled by all current and past NFT holders (le Directoire).

        But what are the funds for, exactly? What is the raison d'être? That’s
        up to you to decide, truly. <br />
        <br />
        Fund a politician, change a local law, drop the cash from a helicopter
        on a small town (not investment advice), film a documentary about the
        whole damn thing, we neither care nor have a say. The limit is your
        imagination… and your ability to convince a group of strangers on the
        internet to agree on something. I’m sure someone will come up with
        something. <br />
